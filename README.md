# RomCom - Pair Project

## Background
For our Mod 1 paired project at Turing, we've built a site for romance novel enthusiasts to generate their own romance novel cover.

## Overview  
Users can design their own book cover from scratch, or use a 'random cover generator' to display a romance book cover using pre-loaded: cover images, titles, and tagline descriptors. Users have the ability to save, view, and delete book covers.

## Programming Language
JavaScript

## Installation and Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the repository
3. Open this site in the browser by running `open index.html` in your terminal

## Features   
* Random Cover Generator    
We've created a function that will generate a book cover with a random cover image, title, and descriptors. The random cover generator creates a new random cover when the page is loaded, as well as upon the click of a 'Show New Random Cover' button.

* Make Your Own Cover  
A form is provided where the user can design and view their own custom made cover.

* Save Cover  
Users can save randomly generated covers and their own custom covers. The save cover button has the functionality to avoid saving duplicate images.

* View Saved Covers  
Users can view all of their saved covers simultaneously.

* Home Screen Button   
Returns user to home screen.

* Delete Cover  
Users can delete unwanted covers from the saved covers section with a double-click.

## Next Steps
To improve our website we could:   
 * Implement data validation and error handling into the form so if a user doesn't input data correctly an error message will pop up.  
 * Improve display options for images i.e. if a user single clicks a saved cover it will enlarge.  
 * Enable users to drag and drop saved posters so they can re-order they way they're displayed.
