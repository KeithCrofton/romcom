## Features   
* Random cover generator    
We've created a function that will generate a cover with a random cover image, title, and descriptors. The random cover generator creates a new random cover when the page is loaded, as well as upon the click of the Show New Random Cover button.

* Make your own cover  
A form is provided where the user can design and view their own custom made cover.

* Save cover  
Users can save both the randomly generated covers and their custom covers. The save cover button has the functionality to avoid saving duplicate images.

* View saved covers  
Users can view all of their saved covers simultaneously.

* Home screen button   
Returns user to home screen.

## Next Steps    
Add delete functionality so the user can delete selected covers from the saved covers section.
